**Building Resuable infrastructure with Modules**
- Use Terraform modules to build reusable infrastructure that is easy to scale and maintain.
- Create modular infrastructure components to promote consistency and reusability across environments.
- Use input variables within modules to customize behavior without changing module code.
- Use .tfvars files to dynamically assign variable values for different environments.
